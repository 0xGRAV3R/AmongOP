<How to use>
To get started you will first need to have the PUN 2 plugin imported and set up in your multiplayer project.
You will then need to import at least one of our PUN 2 matchmaking add-ons. (Quick Start, Delay Start, Custom Matchmaking, Code Matchmaking).
Now, set up the Build Order.
(QuickStart) QuickStartMenuDemo = 0, MultiplayerSceneDemo = 1
(DelayStart) DelayStartMenuDemo = 0, DelayStartWaitingRoomDemo = 1 MultiplayerSceneDemo = 2
(CustomMatchmaking) CustomMatchmakingMenuDemo = 0, MultiplayerSceneDemo = 1
(CodeMatchmaking) CodeMatchmakingMenuDemo = 0, MultiplayerSceneDemo = 1;

View the demo scenes to get an idea of how this add-on should behave.

<Features>
Quick Start: This add-on will allow players to connect to a multiplayer room with one click of a button.

Delay Start: This add-on will allow players to load into a waiting room scene until more players connect. Once the max players connect or the timer runs out all connected players will load into the multiplayer scene.

Custom Matchmaking: This add-on will allow players to create their own rooms or join an existing room. Connected players will be waiting in a room menu until the master client clicks the start game button.

Code Matchmaking: This addo-on randomly generates a code when a room is created, players can then share the code with friends that can then use the code to join the same room.

<Customize your project>
Depending on which add-on you need all you need to do is drag the correct prefabs into your project scenes and then customize the prefabs visuals.

Quick Start:
	Drag the PhotonQuickStart prefab into your main menu scene.
	Drag the GameSetup prefab into your multiplayer scene.
Delay Start:
	Drag the PhotonDelayStart prefab into your main menu scene.
	Drag the PhotonWaitingRoom prefab into your waiting room scene.
	Drag the GameSetup prefab into your multiplayer scene.
Custom Matchmaking:
	Drag the PhotonCustomMatchmaking prefab into your main menu scene.
	Drag the GameSetup prefab into your multiplayer scene.
Code Matchmaking

<Final Notes>
Feel free to change any visual but it is recommended to leave the overall structure of the prefabs alone. If you need additional features You will need to add them yourself.

make sure if you are using your own scenes that you follow the same order as described above with the demo scenes.

These plugins are only meant for matchmaking. Multiplayer game mechanics are not included in this plugin.
